Some avatars are duplicates so that each new design has a spy/res-counterpart.
Most avatars are named to the main account they were used for (not alt),
or the creator if they were never used. Accounts are rarely named after the alt, unless the alt was more well known than the main
(eg. starbird1002 instead of sunbird1002, flanders).

Regarding_TRP_Avatars:
Players whose avatar indexing starts with 2 or more (eg. swaram,tyrrox) in this folder but not -1, usually means
they have a -1 avatar in the TRP folder, unless earlier versions were lost (see Lost/Missing)
